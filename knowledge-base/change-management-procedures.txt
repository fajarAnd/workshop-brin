1. CHANGE MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

Purpose:
Change Management memastikan bahwa perubahan pada IT infrastructure dilakukan dengan cara yang tercontrol, aman, dan meminimalkan dampak negatif terhadap layanan IT.

Scope:
Change Management berlaku untuk semua perubahan pada:
- IT infrastructure (servers, network, storage)
- Applications & databases
- Security configurations
- IT policies & procedures

Goals:
- Minimize service disruptions
- Reduce risk of failed changes
- Enable rapid rollback if needed
- Document all changes for compliance & audit
- Coordinate changes to avoid conflicts

Change Management Process Owner: IT Change Manager
Supporting Team: Change Advisory Board (CAB)

=============================================================================
2. CHANGE CLASSIFICATION & RISK LEVELS
=============================================================================

STANDARD CHANGE (Pre-Approved)

=============================================================================
6. ROLLBACK & BACKOUT PROCEDURES
=============================================================================

Rollback Plan Requirements:

Every change request must include rollback plan with:
1. Rollback trigger conditions (when to rollback)
2. Rollback steps (detailed procedure)
3. Estimated rollback duration
4. Rollback testing evidence (test in non-prod)
5. Data recovery plan (if data changes involved)

Rollback Testing:
- Test rollback in UAT/staging environment
- Verify rollback time estimate
- Document actual rollback steps
- Attach test results to change request

Common Rollback Scenarios:

Application Upgrade:
- Rollback: Restore previous application version from backup
- Database: Restore database to pre-upgrade backup (if schema changed)
- Duration: Typically 1-2 hours
- Data loss: Accept data loss from time of upgrade to rollback (communicate to users)

Configuration Change:
- Rollback: Revert configuration to backup
- Config backup: Automated backup before change
- Duration: Minutes to 1 hour
- Example: Network config, firewall rules, server settings

Infrastructure Change:
- Rollback: Restore infrastructure to previous state
- May involve: VM snapshots, backup restores, manual reconfiguration
- Duration: Hours (longer for complex changes)
- Example: Server migrations, network topology changes

Rollback Decision Timeline:
- Monitor for issues: 1-4 hours post-change (depending on change complexity)
- Decision point: Go/No-Go decision by Change Manager
- If issues detected beyond decision point: Weigh rollback cost vs fix-forward

=============================================================================
7. CHANGE CALENDAR & COORDINATION
=============================================================================

Change Calendar:

Conflict Resolution:
- If conflict detected: Change Manager coordinates resolution
- Options:
  * Reschedule one change
  * Combine related changes (if makes sense)
  * Stagger changes (timing separation)
  * Escalate to IT Manager if cannot resolve

Change Freeze:
- Definition: Period when no changes allowed (except emergency)
- Reasons: Critical business period, major event, high-risk change in progress
- Authority: IT Manager or CIO declares change freeze
- Notification: Minimum 2 weeks notice (for planned freeze)
